    question: "What is React?",
    answer:
      "React is a front-end JavaScript library developed by Facebook in 2011. It follows the component-based approach which helps in building reusable UI components. It is used for developing complex and interactive web and mobile UI. Even though it was open-sourced only in 2015, it has one of the largest communities supporting it. Some of the key features of React are: It uses the virtual DOM instead of the real DOM. It uses server-side rendering. It follows uni-directional data flow or data binding. It follows the reusability of components. It is used for developing complex and interactive web and mobile UI. It is used for developing single-page applications. It is easy to learn and use, and it is fast. It is used for developing both web and mobile applications. It allows us to create reusable UI components. It is used for rendering high-performing user interfaces. It is used for developing both client and server-side applications. It is used for developing cross-platform applications.

    question: "What is JSX?",
    answer:
      "JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript and comes with the full power of JavaScript. You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX. It is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript. You can definitely use React without JSX but JSX makes React a lot more elegant. Just like XML, JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children. If an attribute value is enclosed in quotes, the value is a string. Otherwise, wrap the value in braces and the value is the enclosed JavaScript expression. JSX is not necessary to write React applications but it makes your code more readable and writing it is faster. It is similar to template language, but it comes with full power of JavaScript. It is faster because it performs optimization while compiling code to JavaScript. It is also type-safe and most of the errors can be caught during compilation. It is also easy to write and understand.",
